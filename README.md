**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT**

**PROJECT**:**Student Grade Tracker**

**Key Features**

**Student Information**:

**Grade Calculations:**
                 1. Compute the average grade across all five subjects.
                 2. Convert the average grade into a letter grade based on predefined thresholds.
                 3. Calculate the GPA based on the average grade.

**Output:**
                 1. Display the grades for each subject.
                 2. Show the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

**Functions**:
                 1. calculate_letter_grade(average): Determines the letter grade from the numeric average using a grading scale.
                 2. calculate_gpa(average): Computes the GPA from the numeric average using a GPA scale.
                 3. manage_grades(): Main function to handle input and output. It manages the collection of grades, calculations, and displays results.

**Data Handling:**
                 1. Subjects List: A predefined list of five subjects for which grades are collected.
